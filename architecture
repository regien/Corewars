Assembler:
	Main goal: Take the .s code and convert it to binary.
	How to do it:
		save the whole file to a char arr
		set header in the beginning of file- MagicNumber->prog_name[128]->prog_size->comment[2048]
		create an array with the indexes of
		every time a label is found, save the index in a hash table of the position of the first command
		check if number of register is greater than max one






Virtual machine:
--reading
	check arguments
	read magic number
		if not the right one, give error
	read name
	read size
		if size greater than CHAMP_MAX_SIZE -> error
	read comment
	allocate memory for the whole map
	read file into map
	set plyr_nbr(either from arg, or from next available);

--set up
	write map from binary code in champions
	allocate initial 16 regs;
	point the PCs to the respective beginning of code
	set carry to 0;

--run
	while (1)
		For every process(process_q):
			if (process has running function)
				counter_func--;
				if (clock_func == 0)
					exec_func;
		if (cycle % cycle_to_die == 0)
			remove_dead_processes(process_q);
	
	cycle++;

// GERARDO'S NOTES
// HOW THE PARSER WORKS

	ARGS functionality:
	Help flag
		display then
		- exit
	Dump flags
		- check
		ifnot set to 0
	check warriors -- flag 0
	turn on when reading something not starting with a '-'
		start
		check flag "-n"
		champions_file
			check_name (.cor terminated)
			enter_champs_struct
				champ_struct - SET FD;
		
		FUNCTION - Set_up_player
		AFTER PLAYERS ARE DONE
		- check for duplicate players
			same players with same player number
				^ it doesnt change the position
	
	check if nbr_cycles is invalid (nbr_cycle != 0)
	otherwise just put the DEFINE - CYCLE_TO_DIE

	- Players are set up and allocated in the parser and we set up the
	FD there

	WHEN USING DUMP | you are just printing the memory after
	the number of cycles designated
	IT MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE WHEN USED WITH VISUAL


	if nrb_players > 4
		general_exit();
